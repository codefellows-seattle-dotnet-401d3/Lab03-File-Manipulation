# unit test ATM

A small app intended to explore file minipulation.

## Getting Started

This is a small test app using visual studio 2017. 
You will also need xunit testing. 
You will need to install and run VS2017 in order to run and use the app.

## Features

This program offers full CRUD interaction with a file. The proggram uses the source file for a word guessing game. When finished the game will offer a masked word for the player to guess as well as the ability to view, add to, delete from and delete the file.
